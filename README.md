# The-Forgotten-Rooms
An Adventure Game You Didn’t Know You Needed !

The Forgotten Rooms is a hilarious, mind-bending text-based adventure(for now 👀) where you explore weird rooms, collect stuff, solve puzzles, and try not to lose your sanity. 
Oh, and the narrator? Yeah, they’ve got an attitude. They’ll guide you with sarcasm, jokes, and maybe some questionable advice. Good luck—you’ll need it.

Features

Explore Creepy Rooms: Wander through bizarre rooms filled with surprises, because why not? Some rooms are just there to mess with you.
Item Hoarding: Pick up random junk, drop it, and hope it’s useful later. You start with nothing, so go fetch!
Solve Weird Puzzles: Find hidden doors, crack your brain on puzzles, and scream into the void when you get stuck (kidding, but seriously, good luck).
The Ancient Altar of Doom (Kinda): One special room with a major quest or a boss fight. Win, and the room poofs out of existence. No re-entry.
Sassy Narrator: Oh, you’ll get plenty of “help” from the narrator. They’ve got jokes, sass, and probably a swear word or two when you mess up.
Monsters & Invisibility: Yes, you can chug a Phantom Potion and go invisible, but watch out for the creepy monsters lurking around.
Win by Collecting Stuff: Your goal is to find 10 important items. Easier said than done, right?

How to Play

Use simple commands like search, pickup, drop, and use to get around and interact with the game world.
Figure out what items you need, what rooms are hiding, and how to not get lost.
Solve puzzles, avoid monsters, and keep your cool—well, try to, anyway.

Tech Stuff

Made with C: A classic, clean text-based adventure, coded entirely in C. No flashy graphics-for now 👀-just pure retro fun.
Organized Code: It’s all nicely split into files like game.c, game.h, and main.c. Easy to maintain and expand.

The Forgotten Rooms is a mix of adventure, puzzles, and a narrator who won’t hesitate to roast you. Can you survive the sass and collect all the items?
